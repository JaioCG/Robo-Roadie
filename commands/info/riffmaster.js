Open the Settings app -> Apps -> Installed Apps (or search for Add and Remove Programs)\n2. look for a package named "Microsoft GameInput". Check if there are 2 versions installed.\n3. If so, uninstall the one that was installed most recently (ask if unsure). That is the version causing the issue.\n4. After uninstalling, unplug/replug the dongle and restart YARG.');
